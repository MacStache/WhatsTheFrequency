                <p> <b>What's The Frequency</b> is a web application that allows the user to find the radio frequencies available 
                    at the location that they are at right now. The site uses a script to parse the contents of a text file into a table, 
                    which hosts all the publicly available radio frequencies in Finland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frequencies have been collected from the 
                    <a href="https://www.traficom.fi/en/communications/tv-and-radio/radio-stations-finland">publicly available database</a> of 
                    <a href="https://www.traficom.fi/en">Traficom</a>, the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frequencies can be downloaded as a <a href="https://github.com/MacStache/WhatsTheFrequency/blob/main/text/frequencies.txt">text file</a> 
                    from the <a href="https://www.traficom.fi/en/communications/tv-and-radio/radio-stations-finland">Traficom website</a>.
                    The downloaded file included a lot of data that is unnecessary for this project, which means that it needed to be cleaned. 
                    The cleaning was done using a <a href="https://github.com/MacStache/WhatsTheFrequency/blob/main/text/cleaner.py">Python script</a>.
                    The resulting <a href="https://github.com/MacStache/WhatsTheFrequency/blob/main/text/cleaned_frequencies.txt">text file</a> 
                    only includes the locations, names and frequencies of the radio stations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frequencies table includes a search bar that allows the user to search for a specific location which will then be used to filter the frequencies.
                    The site also includes an automated script that will add a link to the stations website. The link table was stripped from the cleaned frequencies text file and 
                    ran again through a modified <a href="https://github.com/MacStache/WhatsTheFrequency/blob/main/text/linker.py">Python script</a> that removes everything but 
                    the station names from <a href="https://github.com/MacStache/WhatsTheFrequency/blob/main/text/stations_list.txt">the file</a>. 
                    It also removes duplicates which made the link table easier to manage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site also includes a favorites page that allows the user to add their favorite stations to a list. The list is stored in the local storage of the users browser.
                    The functionality also includes a button that allows the user to remove the station from the list, as well as unchecking the checkbox in the frequencies table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site is a final project for the course "Web Applications" at <a href="https://oamk.fi/en/">Oulu University of Applied Sciences</a>.
